# Severstal Steel Defect Detection

## Overview

This repository provides a solution for the Severstal Steel Defect Detection challenge. The model is based on the U-Net architecture in Keras, with an extensible structure for experimentation.

## Theory

The process of steel defect detection can be challenging, involving...

## Model Architecture

The model uses the U-Net architecture, modified to learn to predict all four masks simultaneously. It takes grayscale images as input.

```python
# Python code for the model
# ...

```

## Training

The model is trained on an extensive dataset using a combination of Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) and Dice Loss as the loss function.

```python
# Python code for training
# ...

```

## Evaluation and Submission

The code includes logic for evaluation and submission, which splits the test dataset into batches, runs the model on the results, and converts array masks to Run-Length Encoding (RLE).

```python
# Python code for evaluation and submission
# ...

```
